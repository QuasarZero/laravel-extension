*This is my first composer project*

# Background

You will find these are less the functions for set table comment, when you get use the **Laravel Facade** utility of
`Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema`

So I search some solutions on the community and net

Yes, Soon I got that there is our Chinese dude already published a library to achieve this demand
`zedisdog/laravel-schema-extend`

However, it lacks support for PostgreSQL currently, although it does work well on MySQL

After much thinking I decided to write this extension library myself

Thank you for your works to reference! Dear **zedisdog(Jialeo)** orz

# System Requirement

* If you use **PostgreSQL** to your default database, you must ensure it's **version >= 9.0**

# Setup
